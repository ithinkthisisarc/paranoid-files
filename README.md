# Paranoid Files
A file decrypter made with golang and aes encryption that isn't actually that good.

### How to use:
Make a file. Run `go build` in the folder with the files in it. Type `pf` in your console, or `./pf` if you're using a unix computer. The program should walk you through the process.

### What this should be used for
Hiding information on something like a USB drive to hide your secrets from nosy classmates.

### What this should *not* be used for
Government secrets

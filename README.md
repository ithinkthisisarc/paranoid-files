# Paranoid Files
A file encrypter made with golang and aes encryption that isn't actually that good.

### How to use:
Make a file. Run `go build` in the folder with the files in it. Type `pf` in cmd, or `./pf` in the terminal if you're using a unix computer. There's also a `pf.exe` if you don't have golang installed. The program should walk you through the process of encrypting and decrypting.

### What this should be used for
Hiding information on something like a USB drive to hide your secrets from nosy classmates.

### What this should *not* be used for
Government secrets
